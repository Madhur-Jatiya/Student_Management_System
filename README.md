# Student_Management_System
The Student Management System project is a software application designed to help manage student records in a school or college. The project is implemented using Java programming language and MySQL database management system. The system provides an intuitive interface for users to perform various operations such as add, delete, update, and retrieve student records.

Each student record includes name, email, phone number, and address details. The address details consist of street, landmark, city, state, and country. The project uses a relational database schema to maintain the records of students and their addresses. The system also ensures data integrity and consistency by using constraints, primary keys, and foreign keys.

The project can be useful for educational institutions that want to manage student records in an efficient and organized manner. The software application can simplify the tasks of maintaining student records, generating reports, and managing student information. The project can be further extended to include features such as fee management, exam management, and attendance management.
